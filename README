Package uscrypt implements Unix crypt-like password hashing scheme
based on scrypt sequential memory-hard key derivation function.

Format of password hashes:

    $scrypt$logN=<LogN>,r=<R>,p=<P>$<SALT>$<PWDHASH>

where LogN, R, P are scrypt cost parameters encoded as decimal numbers;
SALT is a random salt, PWDHASH is the output of scrypt, both encoded in
Base64 using custom alphabet.
